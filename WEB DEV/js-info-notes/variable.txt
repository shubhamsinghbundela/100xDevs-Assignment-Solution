1. We can also declare multiple variables in one line:
- let user = 'John', age = 25, message = 'Hello';

That might seem shorter, but we don’t recommend it. For the sake of better readability, please use a single line per variable.

The multiline variant is a bit longer, but easier to read:

let user = 'John';
let age = 25;
let message = 'Hello';

2. Const

There is a widespread practice to use constants as aliases for difficult-to-remember values that are known before execution.

For instance, let’s make constants for colors in so-called “web” (hexadecimal) format:

const COLOR_RED = "#F00";
const COLOR_GREEN = "#0F0";
const COLOR_BLUE = "#00F";
const COLOR_ORANGE = "#FF7F00";

// ...when we need to pick a color
let color = COLOR_ORANGE;
alert(color); // #FF7F00

Benefits:

COLOR_ORANGE is much easier to remember than "#FF7F00".
It is much easier to mistype "#FF7F00" than COLOR_ORANGE.
