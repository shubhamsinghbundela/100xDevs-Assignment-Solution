"use strict"
- it is located at the top of a script, the whole script works the “modern” way.

Should we “use strict”?

Modern JavaScript supports “classes” and “modules” – advanced language structures (we’ll surely get to them), that enable use strict automatically. 
So, for now "use strict"; is a welcome guest at the top of your scripts. Later, when your code is all in classes and modules, you may omit it.
