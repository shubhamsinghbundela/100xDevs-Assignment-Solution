This would also work:

alert('Hello')
alert('World')

Here, JavaScript interprets the line break as an “implicit” semicolon. This is called an automatic semicolon insertion.

But there are situations where JavaScript “fails” to assume a semicolon where it is really needed.

alert("Hello")

[1, 2].forEach(alert);

The difference compared to the code above is only one character: the semicolon at the end of the first line is gone.
If we run this code, only the first Hello shows (and there’s an error, you may need to open the console to see it). There are no numbers any more.
That’s because JavaScript does not assume a semicolon before square brackets [...]. So, the code in the last example is treated as a single statement.

Here’s how the engine sees it:

alert("Hello")[1, 2].forEach(alert);


Please, don’t hesitate to comment your code.

Comments increase the overall code footprint, but that’s not a problem at all. 
There are many tools which minify code before publishing to a production server. 
They remove comments, so they don’t appear in the working scripts. 
Therefore, comments do not have negative effects on production at all.

Ctrl+/ hotkey for a single-line comment and something like Ctrl+Shift+/ – for multiline comments
