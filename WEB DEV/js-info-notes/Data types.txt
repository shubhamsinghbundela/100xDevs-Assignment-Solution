1. BigInt
In JavaScript, the “number” type cannot safely represent integer values larger than (253-1) (that’s 9007199254740991), or less than -(253-1) for negatives.
BigInt type was recently added to the language to represent integers of arbitrary length.

A BigInt value is created by appending n to the end of an integer:

// the "n" at the end means it's a BigInt
const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;

2. The “null” value
The special null value does not belong to any of the types described above.
It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null value:

let age = null;
It’s just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.

3. The “undefined” value
The special value undefined also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like null.
The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.

If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined:

let age;
alert(age); // shows "undefined"

4. typeof null // "object"
The result of typeof null is "object". That’s an officially recognized error in typeof, 
coming from very early days of JavaScript and kept for compatibility. Definitely, 
null is not an object

5. typeof(x). It’s the same as typeof x.
